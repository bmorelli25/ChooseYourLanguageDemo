# Choose Your Language - Simple Android App
###Simple Android App that introduces 3 important topics: *Shared Preferences, Menu customization, and Alert Dialogs!*

#####Shared Preferences: 
An easy way to store small amounts of data on the android device. Initiate and store the users language in this coding example. 

#####Menu customization: 
Customizing the order, layout, and on click options of the built in Android Menu. In this example we add a "Language" button to the menu for easy editing of the app language. 

#####Alert Dialogs: 
Pop up boxes asking the user to select an option. In this example, an alert dialag asks the user to specify which language they would like the app to run in. 

**As always, the code is well documented and should explain what each line does. Please email me if you have additional questions!**
